\problemname{Count Nodes}
A tree on $N$ nodes labeled with integers between $0$ and $N-1$ is given. Your task is to answer the following query:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given the node $u$ and the integer $d$, count the number of unique nodes that can be reached from $u$ by
    crossing at most $d$ edges.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the integers $N$ and $Q$ ($1 \leq N,Q \leq 2*10^5$), the number of nodes and queries.

The following $N-1$ lines each contain the integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \leq a,b \leq N-1$), which means that
there is an edge between node $a$ and $b$. These edges are guaranteed to form a tree.

Then, the next $Q$ each contain a query. 

Each query consists of the integers $u$ and $d$ ($1 \leq u,d \leq N-1$), the starting node and the number of edges
you may cross.

\section*{Output}
For each query, print the number of unique nodes that can be reached from $u$ by crossing at most $d$ edges.

\section*{Scoring}
Your solution will be tested on multiple testcases.
\noindent
To solve the problem, your solution must solve every testcase correctly.
