\problemname{Subset sum 5}
You are given $N$ integers. Your task is to determine whether there exists a subset of these integers, whose
sum is exactly $T$. If such a subset exists, output any such subset. Please also note the unusual memory limit.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains the integers $N$ and $T$ ($1 \leq N \leq 4000$, $0 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^6$), the number of
integers and the target sum.

The following line contains $N$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq T$), the integers
described above.

\section*{Output}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If there exists a subset of the input with sum equal to $T$, print \texttt{YES}. 
    On the next line, print a binary string of length $N$. The $i$:th character means that
    the $i$:th element in the input should be included your subset. If there are multiple valid subsets
    answers, you can print any of them.
    \item If there doesn't exist a subset with sum $T$, print \texttt{NO}.    
\end{itemize}
