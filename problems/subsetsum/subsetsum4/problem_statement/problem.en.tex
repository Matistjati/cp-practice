\problemname{Subset sum 4}
You are given multiple integers. Your task is to answer whether there exists a subset of these integers, whose
sum is exactly $T$.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the integers $M$ and $T$ ($1 \leq M \leq 500$, $1 \leq T \leq 10^{18}$),
the largest number in the input and the target sum.

The next line contains $M+1$ integers $n_0, n_1, \dots, n_M$ ($1 \leq n_i \leq 10^{12}$). For each $i$,
$n_i$ means that there are $n_i$ integers of value $i$.

\section*{Output}
Print \texttt{YES} if there is such a subset, otherwise print \texttt{NO}.

\section*{Explanation of sample 1}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n_0=0$ means that there are no zeros.
  \item $n_1=3$ means that we have the integer $1$.
  \item $n_2=0$ means there are no twos.
  \item $n_3=3$ means that we have the integers $3,3,3$.
  \item $\cdots$
  \item $n_7=2$ means that we have the integers $7,7$.
\end{itemize}

If we choose the subset $\{3,3,3,7\}$, we get a subset with sum $16$. Thus, the answer is \texttt{YES}.
